## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background
Forklift manufacturing companies face challenges in optimizing operations across sales, production, and maintenance. Data analytics can provide actionable insights to improve production quality, reduce downtime, and enhance customer satisfaction by focusing on trends, patterns, and anomalies within business operations.

### 1.2. Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate data analytics skills by analyzing sales, production, and maintenance data for a hypothetical forklift manufacturing company using SQL and Google Sheets. The analysis aims to uncover trends and anomalies and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.

## 2. Tools and Technologies Used

### 2.1 SQL
SQL was utilized to manage and manipulate the data stored in the database. SQL queries were used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

### 2.2 Google Sheets
Google Sheets was used for data visualization to display key trends and insights using charts, graphs, and dashboards.

## 3. Database Setup and Data Collection

### 3.1 Database Overview
The project data revolves around the following key operational areas: Sales, Production, and Maintenance. Each area has its own table within the database:

- **Sales Table**: Records details about forklift sales transactions.
- **Production Table**: Contains production-related data including units produced, defects, and defect types.
- **Maintenance Table**: Tracks maintenance issues, their resolution times, and costs.

### 3.2 SQL Database Creation
Step 1: A database named `Forklift_Manufacturing` was created to store the tables and manage the data for analysis.

### 3.3 SQL Tables Creation
Three tables were created using SQL to hold sales, production, and maintenance data:

- **Sales Table**: Contains sales data with details on sales date, sales amount, region, and customer type.

- **Production Table**: Captures production details, including units produced, defects, and defect types.

- **Maintenance Table**: Records maintenance activities, issue types, resolution times, and costs.

## 4. Data Cleaning and Transformation (SQL)

### 4.1 Overview of Data Quality Issues
Raw data is often inconsistent or contains errors, such as missing values, duplicate entries, or outliers that can affect analysis. Data cleaning and transformation steps were taken to ensure data quality before proceeding with analysis.

### 4.2 Data Cleaning Steps

#### Step 1: Identify and Remove Duplicates
Duplicate rows in the Sales, Production, and Maintenance tables were identified and removed to prevent skewed analysis.

#### Step 2: Handle Missing Values
Missing values in columns, such as defects in the Production table, were handled. For instance, missing defect data was filled with 0 when no defects were reported.

#### Step 3: Data Transformation
Standardization of regions, defect types, and date formats was performed to ensure data uniformity. Region names were corrected for consistency, and dates were verified for accuracy.

## 5. Data Analysis and Insights

After cleaning and transforming the data, SQL queries were run to generate key insights from the Sales, Production, and Maintenance data.

### 5.1 Sales Analysis

#### Step 1: Total Sales by Region
Total sales for each region were computed to identify top-performing geographical areas.

**Insight**: The "North" region contributed the highest sales, suggesting more resources should be allocated to it. In contrast, the "East" region underperformed, signaling an opportunity for improvement or further analysis.

#### Step 2: Customer Type Analysis
Sales were analyzed based on customer types, distinguishing between industrial and retail customers.

**Insight**: Industrial customers made up 65% of total sales, establishing them as the primary customer segment. Retail customers showed growth, which suggests potential in expanding to that market.

### 5.2 Production Analysis

#### Step 1: Production Efficiency
The number of units produced was analyzed alongside the number of defects for each forklift model.

**Insight**: Forklift models 101 and 105 had higher defect rates (4% and 5%, respectively), indicating that these models might require design improvements or better quality control.

#### Step 2: Defect Type Distribution
An analysis of common defect types was performed to understand recurring issues.

**Insight**: Battery defects constituted 40% of all issues, with motor defects following closely at 35%. Focusing on improving battery designs could yield significant improvements in production quality.

### 5.3 Maintenance Analysis

#### Step 1: Maintenance Cost per Issue
The average maintenance cost per issue was calculated to identify the most expensive types of maintenance tasks.

**Insight**: Motor issues were the most expensive, with an average cost of $700 per instance. Battery-related maintenance followed at $500. Improving motor quality could lead to substantial cost savings.

#### Step 2: Forklifts with Highest Maintenance Costs
Forklifts with the highest total maintenance costs were identified.

**Insight**: Forklift model 102 incurred the highest maintenance costs due to repeated motor issues, highlighting the need for a redesign or more frequent maintenance.

## 6. Visualization in Google Sheets

The cleaned data was exported to Google Sheets for creating visualizations:

- **Sales by Region**: A bar chart was used to show total sales for each region, emphasizing the dominance of the "North" region.
- **Defect Type Distribution**: A pie chart illustrated the percentage of each defect type, with battery issues representing the largest portion.
- **Maintenance Cost Trends**: A line chart visualized the increasing costs associated with motor-related maintenance.

## 7. Conclusion

This project highlights the potential of data analytics in improving forklift manufacturing operations. Key insights from sales, production, and maintenance data helped identify opportunities to optimize operations. The project demonstrated how SQL can be used for cleaning, transformation, and analysis, while Google Sheets was used to create visualizations for better decision-making.

### Key Recommendations:
- **Sales Focus**: Increase marketing efforts in high-performing regions (e.g., "North") and address underperforming regions (e.g., "East").
- **Production Improvements**: Prioritize battery and motor component improvements to reduce defect rates.
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Implement preventive measures to reduce maintenance costs associated with motor issues.
